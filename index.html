        <h1>Data Science for Economists.</h1>
   
        <h3>Inflation</h3>
        <p>The first chart shows the UKs inflation target over time</p>
        <div class="chart" id="Chart1"></div>

        <h3>Interest rate</h3>
        <p>My second chart shows the main policy rate set by the Bank of England over time</p>
        <div class="chart" id="Chart2"> </div>

    <div class="myWeek2">
        <h1>Week 2</h1>
        
        <h3>IMF credit outstanding</h3>
        <p>The first chart shows the nominal value of credit outstanding for all IMF members</p>
        <div class="chart" id="Chart3"></div>

        <h3>In real terms</h3>
        <p>To understand the ability to pay off debts, we must compare debt to income. In this chart we normalise the credit outstanding by dividing through by the value of world GDP each year. (GDP values given in 2015 USD). The results show that although IMF credit payments have increased over the given period, the ability to pay off this debt has increased due to growth in gross income. The most 'risky' year would actually be 1984, where lending was the greatest relative to GDP</p>

        <h1>Week 3</h1>
        
        <h3>Carbon Emissions since 1800</h3>
        <p>The chart shows the carbon emissions in billions of metric tonnes since 1800</p>
        <div class="chart" id="Chart5"></div>

        <h3>Improved Chart</h3>
        <p>Here i have changed the visual encoding to show the data in a line chart rather than a bar chart. A line chart is more appropriate here as it emphasises the change in carbon emissions over time, rather than unrelated unique data points.</p>

        <h1>Week 4</h1>
        
        <h3>Golfers and Their Time Spent at Number 1</h3>
        <p>This chart shows a selection of the best golfers over time and their time spent at the top of golf rankings. I chose to scrape from this website as the there were a few tables on the web page, allowing me to use the lens() function and to pick the appropriate table. However the data was fairly easy to analyse and use as there were no cookie blockers to the website and the column headers and data were in a usable form already. the link the the code i used to access the data can be found

        <h3>A Range of information on Unemployment in the UK</h3>
        <p>This dashboard uses an API from the ONS which allowed me to access lots of different time series concerning unemployment in the UK. I used a loop in google colab to quickly access all the data via the API. The link to my google colab code can be found

        <h3>Using Maps to convey information</h3>
        <p>This week, we created two maps. the first is a base map of our chosen country. The second is a chloropleth, overlaying English population data onto the base map. Note that the missing districts in the second map are not shown as the dataset does not contain population data on these areas. The tooltip on the chloropleth shows the name of the region and the population of that region.</p>

        <h1>Week 8</h1>
        
        <h3>Festival of Economics</h3>
        <p>In the 'Big Tech Under Control' talk it was mentioned that we shouldnt allow big firms to become so large, in order to protect consumers.</p>
        <div class="chartw8" id="Chart21"></div>
        <div class="chartw8" id="Chart22"></div>
        <p>As market share increases, markups and profits increase (likely meaning higher prices). However, with increased profits, there is increase in R&D, allowing for innovation of better product for consumers.</p>

    <div class="myWeek9">
        <h1>Week 9</h1>
        
        <h3>Advanced Charts</h3>
        <p>The first chart is a scatter plot with bubble size used to represent population size. The second chart is a layered chart with two event studies (in 2015 and 2020 where there are changes in the direction of GDP growth) allowing us to see the correlated movement in GDP per capita and happiness in Finland (measured using the happiness index.)(Event studies were labelled an advanced chart in lectures)</p>

        <h3>Machine learning</h3>
        <h3>Supervised Learning</h3>
        <p>The Chart below uses data on democratic quality and average happiness of a country to test for a correlation.</p>
        </p>
        <div class="chartw8" id="Chart23"></div>
        <p> The output of the regression along with visual evidence from the chart suggests that there is a weak, positive correlation between the two variables. the code used to regress the data can be found
